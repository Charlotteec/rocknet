HoW does it work? 
Using the already weighted imagenet network as a starting point, I collected 100 images in each category so that the network could recognize my rocks. After exporting my network, I created a run.py file that runs the network on different images. The first cycle of training was not very successful. It was okay, but I think that with more images the network would be able to understand the images better. 

Include a gif of it in real time, and the run.py file that I have created. 

It would also be good to have a graph of what the training process was like - can we output that data?
